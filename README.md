# SiPM-characterization-k2612B
Code written in python to control a Keithley 2612B (or 2400) SourceMeter over GPIB and run characterization routines for an ONSEMI MicroFC-60035 SiPM.

This code was used for the characterization and validation of SiPMs that were integrated in a satellite Payload developed by the University of San Mart√≠n. These SiPMs were operational in LEO from 2020 to 2024. Relevant scientific publications detailing the characterization and in-flight measurements: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07722, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168900220308871.

Program entry point: run.py. All the customizable settings and variables can be found in this script.

Some example images of some characterization curves obtained with this code are included in the repository.
