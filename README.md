# SiPM-characterization-k2612B
Code written in python to control a Keithley 2612B (or 2400) SourceMeter and run characterization routines for an ONSEMI MicroFC-60035 SiPM.

This code was used for the characterization and validation of SiPMs that were integrated in a satellite Payload developed by the University of San Martín. These SiPMs were operational in LEO from 2020 to 2024.
